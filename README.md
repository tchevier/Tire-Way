# Description
Tire Way allows the counterperson to create or search up a customer and add tires to their orders. Each customer comes with a unique invoice, and tires are removed and added to the stock accordingly. Each invoice is saved to the database so their orders can never get deleted unless requested.
- Home: The invoice page displays only when a counterperson has selected or added a customer. It presents all of the tires that have been added, including info such as the tires part #, price, quantity, etc. Customer information is also displayed on the top left.

- Customers: This page consist of both forms for searching a customer that already exist or creating a customer.

- Tires: The tires section reveals all tires that were added to stock in the database. A counterperson can select a quantity and add it to a customer invoice. If tires are removed off an invoice, they will be added back to stock.

- Stock: This screen allows the counterperson to add tires to stock.
